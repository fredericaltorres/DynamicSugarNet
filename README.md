DynamicSugar.net /Standard
===============

## What is DynamicSugar.Net?
* In 2011 I created the Dynamic Sugar Library which 
provides methods and classes inspired by the dynamic 
languages Python and JavaScript to write shorter and more readable source code in C# 4.0.

* From 2011 to 2022, I sligthly updated the library. 
* From 2011 to 2020, the C# language evolved and some feature in DynamicSugar are no obsolete, like
the DynamicSugar string interpolation feature. But most of the feature are still usefull and I want 
to use them in my .NET 4.6.1 and .NET Core development in 2023.

* In 2023 I moved the library to .NET Standard 2.0, so it can be used with .NET 4.6.1 and .NET Core.

DynamicSugarCore.net
===============

## What is DynamicSugarCore.Net?
The Dynamic Sugar Library provides methods and classes inspired by the dynamic 
languages Python and JavaScript to write shorter and more readable source code 
in C# 4.0.

* The library was created in 2011.
* In 2019 I ported the library to DotNetCore.

***Outdated***
- The extension methods string.Format() and and string.Template() are now out dated,
since C# support string interpolation.
- The class MultiValues was an attempt to create functions returning multiple values, which is now supported by C#.

### A lot of the features are still usefull see  [Examples](http://frederictorres.blogspot.com/2014/03/dynamicsugarnet.html)
